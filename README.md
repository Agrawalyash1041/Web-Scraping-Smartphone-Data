# Web Scraping :- 
        I have used Beautiful Soup Library to extract the data from the flipkart website.
        I have successfuly scraped the data from all the 221 pages which had information about the smartphones.
        You can refer to the codes stored in a  ipynb file named as web Scraping Smartphone data.
        
# Data Cleaning and Feautre Selection :-
       The raw data that was scraped is stored in the CSV file named Smartphone Data 
       The raw data contains a column named specs which has all feautres of the smartphone saved in it.
       I have disected each feature and put it in its column using Excel
       Then all the columns were stored into a new csv named as Cleaned Smartphone Data.
       Although it does has some null values or NAN values in some columns, Which should removed while using this file into a project
